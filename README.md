# ESP32 I2C HMC5883L library for esp-idf

This is a library of hmc5883l for [esp-idf](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf).

Code modified from [Arduino-HMC5883L](https://github.com/jarzebski/Arduino-HMC5883L).

The I2C driver is a software one. So you can use any two GPIO pins which support both input and output as SDA and SCL.
